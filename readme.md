# Interview with David Jickling

This fascinating interview with my grandfather is available from the Library of
Congress, but the only formats available are PDF and XML.
The accessibility of the reading experience left a lot to be desired!

I took the XML file, and added a stylesheet link. Using only a CSS file to
manipulate the XML tags I made adjustments that resulted in a more reader
friendly document.

The original XML file can be found here:
