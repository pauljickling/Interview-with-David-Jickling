# Interview with David Jickling

This fascinating interview with my grandfather is available from the Library of
Congress, but the only formats available are PDF and XML.
This reading experience left a lot to be desired!

I took the XML file, and added a stylesheet link. Using only a CSS file to
manipulate the XML tags I managed to make some adjustments that resulted in what
I felt to be a much more reader friendly document.
